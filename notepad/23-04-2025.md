11:53 why am i doing these i have messed up my sleep yesterday i slept at 2'O clock this morning i am doing everything wrong why i am doing these watching pornography all night and masturbating and after that watching some youtube contents that i don't know why i am watching these at that time I don't know what is the point of doing all these bad things, but i damn sure i get some pleasure a big ass dopamine hit that consequetively increased my dopamine spike makes me boring for doing the day to day work that will make my work accomplished but i am not doing that but i knew that by continuing this habit will definitely makes me a worst me of myself. I am thinking know that my brain has two parts, i  mean a good fellow and bad you name it, i name it as good dharun and bad dharun, good dharun try doing hard and need to do things and somehow he'll accomplish that. After some time getting some time getting good feelings good dharun definitely feel little boring then here opens the door for the bad dharun that says the good dharun go to sleep, and try to gain control over me by doing things watching useless contents in youtube and pornography, thinking about fantasies that won't ever happen, and some how accomplish things and feels  immediate pleasure and also get tired then he wakes up the good dharun and told him that i feel great doing things but i also feared that i messed up the body and the pretty much scared about the future what i am going to be, then telling this to the good dharun feels anxiety. That's all i am done with this i am done with bad dharun, I should try to motivate the good dharun as much as possible and i'll definitely do that. Let's hope the good for my future.
