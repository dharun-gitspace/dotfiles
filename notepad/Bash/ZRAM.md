Yes, you can absolutely use both **swap** and **ZRAM** together! In fact, this is a common setup on many Linux systems, especially those with limited RAM. Using both allows you to take advantage of the speed of ZRAM while still having the fallback of traditional swap when needed.

### **How to Use Both Swap and ZRAM Together**
When you enable both ZRAM and swap, the system will prioritize ZRAM for swapping because it’s faster (since it uses compressed RAM). If ZRAM fills up, the system will then use the traditional swap space on your disk.

#### **Steps to Set Up Both:**
1. **Enable ZRAM**:
   - Install `zram-tools`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install zram-tools
     ```
   - Configure ZRAM by editing `/etc/default/zramswap`. For example, set `MEM_FACTOR=2` to allocate twice your RAM size in compressed swap.
   - Restart the ZRAM service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart zramswap
     ```

2. **Enable Swap**:
   - If you don’t already have swap space, create a swap file (e.g., 4GB):
     ```bash
     sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
     sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
     sudo mkswap /swapfile
     sudo swapon /swapfile
     ```
   - Make the swap file persistent by adding it to `/etc/fstab`:
     ```bash
     echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
     ```

3. **Verify Both Are Active**:
   - Check ZRAM and swap usage with:
     ```bash
     cat /proc/swaps
     ```
   - You should see both ZRAM and your swap file listed.

### **How the System Prioritizes ZRAM and Swap**
- The Linux kernel uses a **swappiness** value to determine how aggressively it swaps data out of RAM. The default swappiness value is usually `60` (on a scale of 0 to 100).
- When both ZRAM and swap are enabled:
  - The system will first use ZRAM for swapping because it’s faster.
  - If ZRAM fills up, the system will then use the traditional swap space on your disk.

#### **Adjust Swappiness (Optional)**:
- You can tweak the swappiness value to control how aggressively the system uses ZRAM and swap.
- To check the current swappiness value:
  ```bash
  cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
  ```
- To temporarily change the swappiness value (e.g., to `40`):
  ```bash
  sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=40
  ```
- To make the change permanent, edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and add:
  ```bash
  vm.swappiness=40
  ```

### **Advantages of Using Both ZRAM and Swap**
1. **Speed**: ZRAM is much faster than disk-based swap because it uses compressed RAM.
2. **Fallback**: If ZRAM fills up, the system can still use traditional swap to avoid running out of memory.
3. **Efficiency**: ZRAM reduces the need for disk-based swap, which can wear out SSDs over time.

---

### **Example Scenario**
- You have **8GB of RAM** and enable **4GB of ZRAM** (compressed) and **4GB of traditional swap**.
- When your system starts using more than 8GB of memory:
  - The kernel will first use ZRAM for swapping (fast, compressed RAM).
  - If ZRAM fills up, it will start using the traditional swap file on your disk (slower but provides additional memory).

---

### **Monitoring ZRAM and Swap Usage**
- Use the following commands to monitor your memory usage:
  ```bash
  free -h
  cat /proc/swaps
  ```
- Tools like `htop` or `vmstat` can also help you monitor memory and swap usage in real-time.

By combining ZRAM and swap, you get the best of both worlds: the speed of ZRAM and the reliability of traditional swap. This setup is particularly useful for systems with limited RAM, like yours. Let me know if you need further assistance!
